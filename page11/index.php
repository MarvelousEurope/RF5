				<h4 class="tit_m"><span>Monster Farmhands</span></h4>
				<p class="text">Once you’ve grown close to your monster friends, you can ask them to help around the farm. High friendship levels let you assign them a greater variety of tasks. Monsters can sow seeds, harvest crops, and collect debris cluttering your fields.</p>

							<strong><span>Caring For Monsters</span></strong>
							<p>Keep your monsters happy with daily gifts and brushings. Adding fodder to your fodder bin will boost friendship levels and give your monsters the energy they need to work. Always keep plenty of fodder on hand, otherwise they’ll stop producing items like eggs and milk.</p>
