Interact with a piece of furniture and select “Pick it up” from the menu to move it wherever you like, using the furniture outline as a guide. If this outline turns red, then you can’t place anything there.</p>

							<strong><span>Furniture Storage Area</span></strong>
							<p>You can send any furniture you’ve bought to your room or a storage area on a farm dragon. However, you can’t buy new furniture until you’ve moved your previous purchase. Placing any furniture on an empty platform will also prevent you from buying new furniture, so keep the area clear!</p>
